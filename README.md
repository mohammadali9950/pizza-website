A simple static website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is a front-end-only project with no backend or database, making it lightweight and easy to deploy. The website includes a basic HTML structure, custom styling with CSS, and interactive features powered by vanilla JavaScript. All files are contained in a straightforward folder structure, typically including index.html, style.css, and script.js.

To use or preview the website, simply download or clone the repository and open the index.html file in any modern web browser. There are no dependencies, build tools, or installations required. Since itâ€™s a static project, it can be hosted on platforms like GitHub Pages static file hosting.

This project is ideal for learning front-end development, building simple personal websites, or serving as a starting point for more advanced projects.
